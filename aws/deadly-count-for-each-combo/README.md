## INMPORTANT NOTE

This code does not represent any best practices for AWS or terraform code for managing ACM with multiple domains and public hosted zones. It only give an solution to the stackoverflow query.

I would not recommend to use combination of `count` and `for_each` together to loop/iterate and reference in respective resources.
